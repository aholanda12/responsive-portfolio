# responsive-portfolio

This is a project in which we were to make a portfolio page for ourselves that was responsive depending on certain screen sizes. There were certain difficulties when it came to using bootstrap but overall it was a very eye opening experience. What was most interesting was creating the portfolio page itself--I decided to use actual work that I had done thus far in the programming. From my first HTML page from the prework to the last homework of refactoring code, it was refreshing to see them linked on a page I had created myself. I feel like I have come a long way and plan to go even further with each new assignment and challenge.
